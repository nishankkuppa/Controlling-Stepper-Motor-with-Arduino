# Controlling-Stepper-Motor-with-Arduino

This report describes the functions and features of stepper motors, as well as how to leverage stepper motors using an Arduino. Various stepper motors were studied, and one specific (unipolar) motor was chose to experiment with. The first task of this lab required finding the sequence of numbers that cause the motor shaft to rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise. Then, the Arduino stepper library was used to rotate the stepper motor shaft based on the position of the potentiometer. The Arduino was then used to drive the stepper motor in its “wave” (normal) mode. Aside from the wave mode, two other modes were tried: high-torque mode, and half-stepping mode. These modes allow the stepper motor to have a finer resolution in steps and/or drive the shaft at a higher output torque.
